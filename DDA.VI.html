we just build '<strong><u>smarter</u>'</strong>&nbsp; apps &amp; services that leverage the leading auto tech &amp; Enterprise Big Data tech (security, NoSQL, Cloud, XML Messaging, Constraint logic, Social Psychometrics) , while working on some of the <strong>most important, unsolved problems</strong> of computer science.</em><br><br><strong>[ I ]</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>If you are an auto expert</strong> and <u>think</u> you know <em><strong>everything there is to know</strong></em> about your <u>industry</u> &amp; your <u>customers</u>, we find that runs a bit contrary to the <strong>fact </strong>that the world of <strong>fast</strong> auto I/T &amp; cloud tech has little to do with simple SQL or relational databases, and few auto managers understand (like big corporate managers know) how psychometrics easily doubles sales &amp; customer satisfaction, by predictably addressing each person's needs, motivation and values. &nbsp; Given our experience with <em>legacy programming, DevOps, psychometrics, AI, business intelligence, analytics &amp; Enterprise technologies</em>, we <u>document everything</u>, and <strong>share our expertise openly</strong> with other Open Source Enterprise programmers &amp; research professionals (across multiple industries), effectively enticing our competition to <strong>collaborate vs. compete</strong> w/ our polymath approach to <u>any data challenge</u> (e.g. What you didn't know that you didn't know, or future reverse engineering).<br><br><strong>&lt; A &gt; &nbsp; Respectively, understanding </strong>the deep analytics &amp; outputs we will generate from your data, external data, devices, and from our IT and psychometric programming services is much akin to learning to sail a boat, or drive a car. &nbsp;It doesn't take much for anyone to grasp the basics, but few people have the time, nor interest, nor natural abilities, to learn to master these arts, which only comes from extensive experience and insight studying the objective from angles the competition hasn't mastered . &nbsp;For example, while most people would think speed and weight wins the race game, for many years fuel mileage that required one less pitstop was the deciding factor.<br><br><strong>&lt; B &gt;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>We can show you</strong> how to <u>generate more billable revenues</u> for your sales people, developing needs analysis for prospects, that gives each prospect a charitable, tax deductible receipt for that billing, similar to being a tax consultant. &nbsp;That's true <em><strong>thinking outside of the box </strong></em>and likely a story <em>you haven't heard before.</em><em> &nbsp;</em>It will also <em>significantly reduce your attrition.</em> &nbsp;Similarly, using psychometrics, it's <em>easy to scoop your competition</em>, from a <strong>crystal ball like understanding of each person's very predictable needs, motivations and values, and the associated best ways to communicate</strong> (phone, email, in-person) with each prospect &amp; client, <strong>based on each salesperson's personality. </strong>&nbsp;It will also be help your teams collaborate better with the objective of best fulfilling their collective needs, motivations and values for their efforts, picking the right people also from the start.<br><br><strong>[ II ] &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DDA's business focuses primarily </strong>on technology &amp; services that leverage our engineering expertise &amp; enterprise data analysis/content manipulation skills with OBD-II 'Smart devices, DTCs, OPCODES, dispatch codes, parts, pricing, overrides, VIN decoding, schema changing content, security, legacy/ cloud/ NoSQL data, CMR3, equity mining, psychometrics, automation <em><strong>that's smarter than salespeople, </strong></em>digital marketing &amp; more from our collective 60+ years in professional services. &nbsp;Our break-throughs are thus, significant and rival the OEMs. &nbsp;A couple of examples follow:<br><br><strong>&lt; A &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;"SMART OBD-II" SERVICE(S):</strong> &nbsp;What started out as a service program for OBD-II DTCs (trouble codes), IFTTT &amp; automated factory maintenance scheduling for new cars, has morphed into a <strong>more automated and intelligent </strong>service dispatch &amp; sustained equity assurance program, that <em>simplifies the mystery, complexity &amp; other overhead associated with OPCODES, Dispatch Codes, DTC's, and the finer details of factory recommended scheduling </em><strong>(<u>per all parts &amp; subsystems</u>)</strong><em> associated with the various warranties, rebates, </em><strong>parts, overrides &amp; pricing</strong><em>, </em>which for most DMS systems, these dispatch details are still half manual (e.g. CDK vs. Toyota) and proprietary (e.g. Non-standard)... which we aim to fix. &nbsp; This gives our claim of being able to increase the average equity value of any car by at least 5% over 5 years validity, as we are watching over every subsystem's subcomponents, in addition to overriding the system defaults (ex: &nbsp;Reducing synthetic oil changes from 10k =&gt; 5k miles, similar to fleet vehicles &amp; their warranties), and documenting everything (like fleet services do for similar reasons). &nbsp;Combine that w/ service by a factory certifed dealership &amp; personal philanthropy... and you have <u>clear market winner on multiple fronts</u>.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Aaron's brainstorm for our "Smart OBD-II" initiative was based on the research of CDK's poor implementation of dispatching, which requires dealers to enter information that should have been automated though advanced programming technologies. &nbsp;Also, similar to Toyota, our objective is to standardize the opcodes and dispatch codes, that support the warranties on all parts vs. just major sub-systems.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>&lt; B &gt; &nbsp; EQUITY MINING: </strong>&nbsp;What we are doing for this component of auto sales, is about as significant as; <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>when Adwords </strong>got started, <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>when car automation started </strong>(Ford), and/or <strong>(3)</strong> <strong>when Oracle transformed </strong>from content management to marketing by analytics (a natural data transition similar to all of the major data providers/analysts). &nbsp; In the process of researching everything standardized about this market, we also grappled with understanding all of <strong>the cases where the conventional processes were not being successfully leveraged</strong>. &nbsp;Based on those findings, we developed an <u>approach similar to the BI analytics for the Insurance &amp; Fortune 500 industries</u>, that <strong>maps psychographics</strong> (e.g. Lifestyle &amp; psychometric variables)... e.g. needs, motivations &amp; values per character type <strong>to a person's predictable likelihood </strong>of making a purchase, <strong>irregardless of their apparent financial status</strong> (which is the key indicator of most systems). &nbsp;<strong>Based on need</strong> alone, these are the 'oddballs' events, <strong>that occur </strong>by post-analysis (people are creative, finding a way to fulfill their key needs), and which, by leveraging psychometrics &amp; personality reports (client to salesperson's personality maps) will give our clients a <strong>significant</strong> advantage over their competition. &nbsp;It's not magic, just good data analytics like actuaries do everyday.<br><br><strong>&lt; C &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;PSYCHOMETRICS FOR AUTO DEALERSHIPS:</strong> &nbsp;As a key forte' or expertise, something we could discuss for hours or just minutes (if you view our presentation), this a a key contribution that <strong>can affect virtually every part of your operation to increase customer satisfaction, sales and team building, </strong>by just having the computer &amp; big data help us out. &nbsp;As <em>one of the most powerful metrics for research</em> (carrying 6-10 trait and behavioral 'habits' per personality type/class/archetype) <em>every conceived</em>, it is logically and financially <strong>irresponsible of you, to not review our offers in detail. &nbsp;</strong>To get started, see our references below and watch of the some videos before giving us a call.<br><br><strong>[ III ] &nbsp;
